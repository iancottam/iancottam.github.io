<p class="p2"><b>April 2013 — present:<br>

<p class="p2">All aspects of research computing support for postgraduates and staff of the University.</p>
<p class="p3"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Dec 2010 — March 2013:<br>
</b><i>Research Computing Evangelist<br>
&amp; Infrastructure Support</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences,<br>
IT Services for Research,<br>
The University of Manchester</b></p>
<p class="p2">All aspects of research computing support for postgraduates and staff of the Faculty.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I support the <a href="http://condor.eps.manchester.ac.uk/"><span class="s1">Condor</span></a> High Throughput Computing service. Condor, at Manchester, has grown over the last few years from its early days just in MIB on 100 PCs to some 3500 processor cores on mainly Teaching Cluster machines. We have provided researchers with over 1,200 accumulated compute years of research results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">I am the co-designer and co-author of the content of EPS Condor’s extensive <a href="http://condor.eps.manchester.ac.uk/"><span class="s1">web site</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2">One of my innovations (adopted nationally by the UK’s National Grid Service) is a drag-and-drop interface to Condor that saves users from having to learn and then use the Linux terminal command line. I named this, more user-friendly, interface: <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=3339"><span class="s1"><i>DropAndCompute</i></span></a>.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">I manage the Cloud Storage trials for the University.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">For the last year, I have written/edited a monthly newsletter on what services we have and how we support them.</p>
<p class="p2">I am a member of the cross-cutting University Computational Operations Team.</p>
<p class="p2">Recently, I have been trialling the 10% time idea by working closely with Prof Popelier's computational chemistry research group in MIB. This has been successful from both sides (contact Prof Popelier for details).</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>

Rosetta has only recently (with the release of OS X Lion in late 2011) been discontinued by Apple. Transitive is now part of IBM.</p>
<p class="p7"> </p>
